create a python app that downloads torrents

I can guide you on how to create a Python app that can handle torrent downloads using the libtorrent library. First, ensure you have it installed. You can use pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install python-libtorrent
Here's a simple example to get you started. Remember, downloading copyrighted material without permission might be illegal in some regions, so make sure to use this knowledge responsibly.

python
Copy code
import libtorrent as lt

def download_torrent(torrent_file_path, save_path):
    ses = lt.session()
    params = {
        'save_path': save_path,
        'storage_mode': lt.storage_mode_t(2)  # Storage mode 2 for sparse allocation
    }
    handle = ses.add_torrent({'ti': lt.torrent_info(torrent_file_path), 'params': params})

    print(f"Downloading {handle.name()} to {save_path}")
    while not handle.is_seed():
        s = handle.status()
        print(f"\rProgress: {s.progress * 100:.2f}%  Speed: {s.download_rate / 1000:.2f} KB/s", end="")
This function download_torrent takes the path to the .torrent file and a directory where you want to save the downloaded files. It uses libtorrent to start the download and displays the progress until the torrent is fully downloaded.

You can call this function by providing the path to your .torrent file and the directory where you want to save the downloaded content:

python
Copy code
torrent_file_path = 'path/to/your/torrent_file.torrent'
save_path = 'path/to/your/save_directory'
download_torrent(torrent_file_path, save_path)
Remember to handle errors and exceptions appropriately and ensure that you comply with laws and regulations related to torrenting and file sharing in your region.

Certainly! Here's the complete code for a simple Python app that downloads a torrent file using libtorrent.

python
Copy code
import libtorrent as lt

def download_torrent(torrent_file_path, save_path):
    ses = lt.session()
    params = {
        'save_path': save_path,
        'storage_mode': lt.storage_mode_t(2)  # Storage mode 2 for sparse allocation
    }
    handle = ses.add_torrent({'ti': lt.torrent_info(torrent_file_path), 'params': params})

    print(f"Downloading {handle.name()} to {save_path}")
    while not handle.is_seed():
        s = handle.status()
        print(f"\rProgress: {s.progress * 100:.2f}%  Speed: {s.download_rate / 1000:.2f} KB/s", end="")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    torrent_file_path = 'path/to/your/torrent_file.torrent'
    save_path = 'path/to/your/save_directory'
    download_torrent(torrent_file_path, save_path)
Remember to replace 'path/to/your/torrent_file.torrent' with the actual path to your .torrent file and 'path/to/your/save_directory' with the directory where you want to save the downloaded content.

This code sets up a function download_torrent that takes the path to the .torrent file and the directory where you want to save the downloaded files. It utilizes libtorrent to initiate and monitor the download progress until completion.
